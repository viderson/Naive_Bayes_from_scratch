# Naive Bayes from Scratch 📊🧠

This repository provides a complete implementation of the **Naive Bayes classifier from scratch** in Python. It is designed as an educational project to understand how probabilistic classifiers work internally, without relying on machine learning libraries like `scikit-learn`.

## 🔍 What is Naive Bayes?

Naive Bayes is a family of simple "probabilistic classifiers" based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between features. It is widely used for:

- Text classification (e.g., spam detection)
- Sentiment analysis
- Medical diagnosis
